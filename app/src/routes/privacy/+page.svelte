					owned and operated by Bos Type Inc. (which may be referred to in the Terms as “we”, “us”,
					KevinAng.com” or Kevin Ang”). It describes the information that we collect from users of
					our Site (“Users”) as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we use and
					disclose this information.
				</p>
				<p>
					By accepting the Privacy Policy in registration or by visiting and using the Site, you
					expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance
					with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our
					<a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> (the “Terms”).
				</p>
				<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from
					your current and past activities on the Site, to provide to you the services offered by
					the Site; resolve service disputes; troubleshoot problems; measure consumer interest in
					our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services,
					events and updates; deliver information to you that, in some cases, is relevant to your
					interests, such as product news; customize your experience; detect and protect us against
					error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce the Terms; provide you with system or
					administrative messages, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
				</p>
				<p>

					analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the
					Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to
					meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized
					experience while using the Site.
				</p>
				<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
				<p>
					Our primary purpose in collecting information from you is to provide you with a safe,
					smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and
					features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your
					experience safer and easier. We only collect information about you that we consider
					necessary for achieving this purpose. We do not collect any credit card or other permitted
					payment method information from you – all payment processing is done by our third party
					payment processors.
				</p>
				<p>
					In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any
					personal information about yourself. Once you become a registered User or begin to make a
					purchase from the Site, we require you to provide various contact and identity information
					and other information as indicated on the relevant forms on the Site, and you are no
					longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are
					required and which fields are optional. In addition, as you use the Site, you can from
					time to time enter or send to us personal information.
				</p>
				<p>
					You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a User or
					by not using the particular feature of the Site for which the information is being
					collected.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our
					Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
					interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.
					This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our
					Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), your
					computer browser information, your IP address and your location.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our
					services. We use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a
					session, and we use data collection devices (such as Google Analytics), including cookies,
					on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional
					effectiveness, and promote trust and safety, to offer certain features that are only
					available through the use of a cookie and to allow us to provide information that is
					targeted to your interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following your registration on the Site, you can review and change your information in
					your account area. If you disclose personal information on the Site and wish to have it
					removed, please contact us at the support contact information posted on the Site.
				</p>
				<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without
					your explicit consent. The following describes some of the ways that your information may
					be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Anonymized Aggregated Data.</strong> We aggregate and anonymize data and use and
						disclose such information for a variety of purposes. However, in these situations, we do
						not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Public Areas of the Site.</strong> All of your activities in the public areas of
						the Site will be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published content.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers.</strong> We may from time to time
						use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation
						of the Site, and may disclose your information to them in the course of our use of their
						services. For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the
						operation of the Site. This may involve the hosting of data, including your information,
						on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers
						that we believe are reputable and able to live up to our and your expectations, including
						about the handling of confidential information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Law and Harm; Jurisdictions.</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
						this policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably
						necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any
						person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or any other person’s
						rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal
						defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request
						to disclose your information. Finally, please note that in some cases, information that we
						collect may be stored or processed outside of Mexico. In such cases, we continue to protect
						the information with appropriate safeguards, but it may be subject to the legal jurisdiction
						of those countries and governmental authorities in those countries.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Sale of Business.</strong> We may also disclose your information to the acquiror
						or its agents in the course of the sale of our business. If we do this, the disclosure will
						be subject to confidentiality arrangements customary in such transactions.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>
					We strive to protect your personal information. For security of transactions, we use the
					Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any personal information you enter
					into registration forms on the Site. The encryption process protects your information, by
					scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. We also make commercially
					reasonable effort to ensure the security of your personal information on our system.
					Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
					As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the
					security of any information you transmit to us.
				</p>
				<h2>Data Retention</h2>
				<p>
					We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to
					provide you services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our goal is to retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
					resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; this retention period may extend past the
					point at which you close your account.
				</p>
				<p>
					The criteria that will be for determining periods of retention will be based on the type
					of data. For example, data relevant to accounting information will be retained for at
					least 7 years, whereas temporary cookie data of a Site visitor may not be retained at all.
				</p>
				<h2>Other Information Collectors</h2>
				<p>
					Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only
					addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that
					you disclose your information to other parties through the Site (including our payment
					processors), different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the
					personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use,
					collection or disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy
					policies. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information
					to others.
				</p>
				<h2>International Transfers of Personal Information</h2>
				<p>
					We store personal information about Users within Mexico, Canada, the United States and in
					other countries and territories. To facilitate our operations, we may transfer and access
					such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which
					we have operations. Therefore, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (the
					“EEA”), your personal information may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries
					which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not
					provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an
					adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses
					for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR), or we will
					ask you for your prior consent to such international data transfers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your
					personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA. For further details on
					the transfer of your personal information, including a list of the organizations with whom
					said information may be shared, please reach out to our team at the email address provided
					below.
				</p>
				<h2>Residents of the EEA and the State of California</h2>
				<p>
					If you are a resident of the EEA or the State of California you may have additional rights
					relating to the privacy of your information. We comply with the privacy laws applicable to
					residents of the EEA and the State of California. Please contact us at the email address
					provided below if you have questions about your rights or wish to exercise them.
				</p>
				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<p>
					It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. If you have questions,
					concerns or if you would like more detailed information, please email our privacy officer
					at <a href="mailto:ka@kevinang.com">ka@kevinang.com</a>.
